# ðŸ§  JavaScript Daily Practice

Welcome to my **JavaScript Daily Practice** repository! ðŸš€  
This repo is a collection of my everyday JavaScript learning and practice exercises. Whether it's basic syntax, DOM manipulation, or advanced topicsâ€”I'll be uploading my daily code here to track my progress and grow as a developer.

## ðŸ“… Daily Commit Schedule
I'll try to commit daily or at least a few times a week (because, hey, college life ðŸ˜…). Each folder or file will be named by date or topic for easy navigation.
